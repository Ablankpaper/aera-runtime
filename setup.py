"""
setup.py — wheel/sdist build guard.

pip/PyPI and Homebrew are no longer supported distribution methods for
Hermes Agent (see website/docs/getting-started/platform-support.md). The
wheel would ship without bundled assets (locales, skills, optional-mcps,
web_dist, tui_dist, plugin manifests) since those are resolved at runtime
via env-var overrides set by the nix wrapper or the source-checkout layout.

This file overrides the ``bdist_wheel`` and ``sdist`` setuptools commands
to raise an error when run outside a Nix build. The PEP 517
``build_wheel`` / ``build_sdist`` hooks in
``setuptools.build_meta`` call these commands internally, so the guard
fires for ``uv build``, ``pip wheel``, ``python -m build``, and direct
``setup.py`` invocations alike.

The legitimate consumers of ``build_wheel`` are uv2nix and the reviewed
AgentEra Runtime Seed builder. ``nix/python.nix`` sets
``HERMES_NIX_BUILD=1`` inside a Nix build sandbox. The Seed builder sets
``AGENTERA_RUNTIME_RELEASE_BUILD=1`` only for its wheel subprocess. AgentEra
does not use this exception for source distributions.

Editable installs (``uv sync``, ``pip install -e .``, ``nix develop``)
use ``build_editable``, which does NOT call ``bdist_wheel`` — it calls
``build_ext`` in editable mode. So the guard does not affect development.
